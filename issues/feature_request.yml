## Feature Summary
Upgrade Bootstrap to the latest version (5.x or newer) and remove jQuery from the project since Bootstrap no longer requires jQuery. This will modernize the codebase and reduce unnecessary dependencies.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the project uses Bootstrap 4.5.0 and jQuery 3.5.1. Bootstrap 5+ does not require jQuery, which is still included in the code and package references. This creates unnecessary dependency overhead and can hinder maintainability.

## Proposed Solution
- Upgrade Bootstrap to the latest version using Yarn: `yarn add bootstrap@latest`.
- Update HTML files (e.g. Code.html, Solve.html) to reference Bootstrap 5+ bundle instead of Bootstrap 4 and jQuery scripts.
- Remove jQuery script tags from HTML files and delete related files from Scripts/.
- Remove jQuery references from YARN_MIGRATION.md as part of the upgrade process.
- Refactor any code that uses jQuery (if present) to vanilla JS or Bootstrap-native event handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Bootstrap upgraded to the latest version
- No jQuery scripts loaded anywhere
- All UI and JS functionality works as before
- Scripts/ folder does not contain vendor JS for Bootstrap or jQuery
- Documentation updated to reflect dependency changes

## Additional Context
Relevant code references:
- [Code.html](https://github.com/ValhallaTech/TacoCatRadar/blob/main/Code.html): `<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js">` and `<script src="//stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/js/bootstrap.min.js">` must be replaced with Bootstrap 5+ bundle only.
- [Solve.html](https://github.com/ValhallaTech/TacoCatRadar/blob/main/Solve.html): Same script tags must be updated.
- [YARN_MIGRATION.md](https://github.com/ValhallaTech/TacoCatRadar/blob/main/YARN_MIGRATION.md): Remove jQuery and Popper.js steps after upgrading Bootstrap.
- [Scripts/jquery-3.5.1.slim.js](https://github.com/ValhallaTech/TacoCatRadar/blob/main/Scripts/jquery-3.5.1.slim.js): Delete as part of cleanup.
